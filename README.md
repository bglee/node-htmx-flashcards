# Express with HTMX Example

This is a simple example of using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) with [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) to create a dynamic web application.

I chose to use [JSXTE](https://github.com/ncpa0/jsxte) to render HTML since it works seemlessly with Typescript code and will look very familiar to React developers.

I am building this off the utility application that I have already started for my zero-to-crud exercises. This uses DynamoDB as the core database to store flashcards.
